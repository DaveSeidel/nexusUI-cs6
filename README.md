nexusUI-cs6
===========

Extension to the nexusUI JavaScript library to support the Csound6 app for Android.

Requires the nexusUI and jQuery JavaScript libraries (see http://www.nexusosc.com/nexusTutorials/).

See SrutiDroneAndroid-nexusUI.csd for an example (still under construction). Upload this file, the file nexusUI.js and the nexUI and jQuery libraries to the same directory on your Android device, and then open SrutiDroneAndroid-nexusUI.csd in the Csound6 app.

See nexusui-test.html for an example that runs in the browser for testing purposes (without Csound).
